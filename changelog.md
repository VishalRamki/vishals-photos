# Changelog

## v1.1

- The `KeyLeft` and `KeyRight` keys can now navigate forward and backward when a folder is loaded.
- Added GPU acceleration info to the Readme file. This was set in v1 but I forgot to include it.
- Fixes bug which causes app to crash when you press the cancel button on the file/folder open dialog
- Sets the file/folder dialogs to expand to the base window height. This would make reading and navigating folders much easier.
- Fixes the bug where opening a folder, browsing through the available images, and then going into full screen would reset the folder to be the first entry.
- Fixes the about dialog so the text doesn't trail off.
